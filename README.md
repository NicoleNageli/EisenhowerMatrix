    - [ ] sort tasks in matrix based on due date, urgency, importance, & difficulty 
    * Q1: Important and urgent do now (tasks with deadlines/consequences)
        task here if important & urgent OR if due in 2- days
        sort by difficulty, highest to lowest
    * Q2: Important but not urgent schedule (tasks for long-term success)
        sort by difficulty
