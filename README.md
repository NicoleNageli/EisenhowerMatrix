## To Do
- [x] add new task to table

- [x] delete task option
- [ ] add hover over information for table headers and quadrants
- [ ] make eisenhower matrix quadrants
    - [ ] sort tasks in matrix based on due date, urgency, importance, & difficulty (idk how yet)
    * display checkbox, task name, difficulty
    * mark complete, cross & gray out task in to do list & remove from matrix
    
    - [x] if due in 2 days or less, highlight days cell red in to do list
       - [ ] move to urgent and important quadrant
    * if higher difficulty, task should be listed higher in matrix quadrant

    * Q1: Important and urgent do now (tasks with deadlines/consequences)
        task here if important & urgent OR if due in 2- days
    * Q2: Important but not urgent schedule (tasks for long-term success)
    * Q3: Not important but urgent delegate/do in spare time
    * Q4: Not important and not urgent ignore
- [ ] shaaaapes and colorrrrs
    - [x] make matrix bigger and to do list on the side smaller
    * color code tasks for difficulty
    * colors for each matrix quadrant
